# 👋 Yo, I’m Floor Mann

💻 **Professional Code Gremlin**  
I make things. Sometimes they work.  
Full-stack web apps, Minecraft plugins, experimental programming languages, cursed file formats — if it’s a bad idea, I’ve probably already done it.  
I break rules, I ignore “best practices,” and I force tech to do stuff it should never, ever do.

---

## 🚀 What I Do (a.k.a. The Chaos List)
- 🖥️ **Software & Web Development** — Frontend, backend, and Supabase (which sucks and I will keep saying it)  
- 🎮 **Game Dev & Modding** — Minecraft plugins, janky mechanics, and data storage that should not exist  
- 🛠️ **Experimental Tech** — Programming languages nobody asked for, HTML variants that offend the W3C, and AI experiments that would make an ethics board cry

---

## 🧠 Current Dumb Projects
- **StupidSimple-HTML** — HTML, but worse, then back to normal HTML, because why not  
- **FileStorage (Minecraft)** — I store files in wool blocks like it’s 3025  
- **Notegrant for Windows** — Notepad and Notepad++ can rot  
- **Floor Certifications** — 100% fake, 0% legal, 1000% me (I don't use it, trust 😏)
- **Gruntcode** — Deprecated, but I still refuse to delete it. Just like MacOS users, who are cr\*ckheads!

---

## 🛡️ Skills & Tools (a.k.a. Weapons)
- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Node.js, HTML (yes, I break HTML on purpose)  
- **Frameworks & Tools**: React, Vite, Tailwind, Plasmo, PaperMC, Electron, and the occasional Next.js just to stay awake  
- **Platforms**: Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and any distro I can break in under 10 minutes
